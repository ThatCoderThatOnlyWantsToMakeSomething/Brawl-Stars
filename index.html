  <p class = "text">Brawl Pass is basiclly a Battle Pass, if you play any other game that has a Battle Pass. If you don't know what the Brawl Pass is, it's kind of something like the 
  Trophy Road. There's a free version where you can earn tokens to get onto the next tier. Each tier has a reward as you are progressing. The other version of Brawl Pass,
  you need to spend 139 gems to get the actual Brawl Pass. It seems like 2 rows of rewards, and you can have even more rewards, as also having the newest Brawler of the
  Season of the game. Also note everytime you reach new tier, the amount of tokens needed will be bigger, starting from 100 to 600 tokens. (70 tiers in total)</p>
  
  <h4 class = "text">Tokens</h4>
  <p class = "text">You mainly get tokens from quest. If you get Brawl Pass, you can use all the premium daily quests. But if you don't, you can do the season quests 
  and normal daily quests. You can 100 to 500 tokens from a quest.</p>
